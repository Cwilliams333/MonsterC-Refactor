# Multi-Select Dropdown Implementation Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Dropdown Components in `src/ui/gradio_app.py`

#### Custom Data Filtering Tab (Lines 266-292)
- Changed all three dropdowns to support multi-select:
  - `operator_filter`: Added `multiselect=True`, changed default value from `"All"` to `["All"]`
  - `source_filter`: Added `multiselect=True`, changed default value from `"All"` to `["All"]`
  - `station_id_filter`: Added `multiselect=True`, changed default value from `"All"` to `["All"]`

#### Load and Update Function (Lines 689-800)
- Updated `load_and_update_wrapped` to return proper multi-select dropdown configurations
- Added `empty_dropdown_multi` for multi-select dropdowns with `value=["All"]`
- Updated return values for dropdowns 19-21 (Custom Filter dropdowns) to use list values

#### Dynamic Station ID Updates (Lines 1841-1877)
- Added new function `update_station_dropdown_based_on_operators` to dynamically update station IDs based on selected operators
- Added event handler for `operator_filter.change` to trigger station ID updates
- Implements OR logic: when multiple operators are selected, shows all stations from ANY of those operators

### 2. Updated Filtering Logic in `src/services/filtering_service.py`

#### Filter Data Function (Lines 163-223)
- Changed parameter types from `str` to `Any` to handle both strings and lists
- Added `should_apply_filter` helper function to check if filters should be applied
- Updated filtering logic to use `isin()` for list values and `==` for single values
- Implements OR logic within each filter (e.g., Operator1 OR Operator2)

#### Display Formatting (Lines 230-351)
- Added `format_filter_value` function to properly display selected values
- Shows first 3 selections followed by "..." if more are selected
- Updated title generation to handle multiple selections in chart titles

### 3. Filter Behavior

The implementation follows these rules:
- **Within a filter**: OR logic (e.g., selecting multiple operators shows data from ANY of those operators)
- **Between filters**: AND logic (e.g., operator filter AND station filter must both match)
- **"All" handling**: If "All" is selected or included in the selection, the filter is ignored
- **Empty selection**: Treated as "All" (no filtering applied)

## Usage Examples

1. **Select Multiple Operators**:
   - Select: ["STN251_RED", "STN252_RED"]
   - Result: Shows data from EITHER operator

2. **Select Multiple Stations**:
   - Select: ["radi101", "radi102", "radi103"]
   - Result: Shows data from ANY of these stations

3. **Combined Filters**:
   - Operators: ["STN251_RED", "STN252_RED"]
   - Stations: ["radi101", "radi102"]
   - Result: Shows data where operator is (STN251_RED OR STN252_RED) AND station is (radi101 OR radi102)

## Testing

The implementation was tested with a test script that verified:
- Single value selection still works
- Multiple value selection filters correctly
- "All" selection shows all data
- Display formatting works for multiple selections
